# Surfs Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if opening a surf/icecream shop in Oahu was sustainable year round. By examing the variances across the weather from June and December we would determine how lucrative this business would be.

## Results
- When looking at the mean temperature from June compared to December we see very little difference. With June having a mean of 74 degrees and December having a mean of 71.
- There was very little difference in the minimum temperatures as well. June had a minimum temp of 64 degrees and December had a minimum temp of 56 degrees. An 8 degree swing, the largesat of all summary statistics but still not a massive difference.
- Much like the other summary statistics the maximum temperature showed very little variation across June and December. June was 85 and December was 83, the smallest difference across the weather statistics. 

## Summary
Ultimately the lack of difference across the weather from June to December is a good sign and one could assume that opening the shop would be lucrative as the weather doesn't change a whole lot. To confrim this notion, I decided to create two more queries looking at precipitaion for June and December as well. Based off the results below we can see much like the temperature statistics there is little difference in precipitation as well.
